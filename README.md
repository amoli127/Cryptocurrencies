# Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of the analysis was to create a report for Accountability Accounting that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment portfolio.
## Results
We used unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster the cryptocurrencies into groups based on their attributes. We first used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, then applied K-Means clustering to group the cryptocurrencies.
Finally, we visualized the results of our clustering analysis using 3D scatter plot and interactive 2D scatter plots.
